The \href{https://github.com/BP2014W1/processeditor}{Processeditor}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BP2014W1/processeditor}} gives the opportunity to create different diagrams.
Those diagrams can be a graphical representation of process models.
They may be used to be executed inside a Process Engine.
